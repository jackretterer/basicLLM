he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said, "that's a lie."
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck
on back roads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
september saw a month of tears
and thankin' god that you weren't here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
and lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
and i'm back for the first time since then
i'm standin' on your street
and there's a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you'll read is:
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
oh, think of me
mmmm
he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said, "that's a lie."state the obvious, i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
[album version line:] that's fine i'll tell mine that you're gay!
[music video version line:] that's fine you won't mind if i say
by the way...
[chorus:]
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're
just another picture to burn!
there's no time for tears,
i'm just sitting here planning my revenge
there's nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
[chorus]
and if you're missing me,
you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here
would be bad for your health...
'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard,
i really really hate that...
[chorus]
burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
you're just another picture to burn
baby, burn...drew looks at me, i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,
and she's got everything that i have to live without.
drew talks to me, i laugh 'cause it's just so funny [radio version]
drew talks to me, i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny [cd version]
that i can't even see anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night
[chorus:]
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do
drew walks by me, can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes, so perfectly,
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight, give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
[chorus]
so i drive home alone.
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight.
'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing, don't know why i do
he's the time taken up, but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into.
drew looks at me, i fake a smile so he won't see.i don't know what i want, so don't ask me
cause i'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road, i'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i'm not the only one
who feels the way i do
[chorus:]
i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
oh, i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
got the radio on, my old blue jeans
and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
but that's ok
[chorus]
maybe i'm just a girl on a mission
but i'm ready to fly
i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
i'll be strong, i'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
oh i'm alone, on my own, and that's all i know
oh i'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
oh i'm just a girl
oh i'm just a girl, oh, oh,
oh i'm just a girlyou have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take, you take the very best of me
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want cause i'm not what you wanted
[chorus:]
oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you
you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
[repeat chorus]
you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried, cried for you
and i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i died, died for you
(died for you)
oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as youi didn't know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason, i know
i didn't read between the lines
and, baby, i've got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right?
[chorus:]
so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you, this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside
you saw me there, but never knew
i would give it all up to be
a part of this, a part of you
and now it's all too late so you see
you could've helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until it's too
late to do anything
[repeat chorus]
so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you, this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outsideseems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you're not pretty
but that's not true, cause i know you...
[chorus:]
hold on, baby, you're losing it
the water's high, you're jumping into it
and letting go... and no one knows
that you cry, but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh, cause it's not his price to pay
not his price to pay...
[chorus x2]
you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone... oh
goodbye, baby
with a smile, baby, babycory's eyes are like a jungle
he smiles, it's like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
there's pretty girls on every corner
that watch him as he's walking home
saying, "does he know?"
will you ever know?
[chorus:]
you're beautiful
every little piece love,
and don't you know
you're really gonna be someone,
ask anyone.
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life lead you back to my door
oh, but if it don't,
stay beautiful
cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
i'm taking pictures in my mind
so i can save them for a rainy day
it's hard to make a conversation
when he's taking my breath away
i should say, hey, by the way...
[chorus]
if you and i are a story
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
i'll never get to hold,
at least you'll know...
you're beautiful
every little piece love,
and don't you know
you're really gonna be someone,
ask anyone.
and when you find everything you looked for,
i hope your life lead you back to my front door.
oh, but if it don't
will you stay
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
la la la
oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, but if it don't,
stay beautiful
stay beautiful
na, na, na, na, nait's strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just looking at you feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said, "yes."
[chorus:]
you should've said "no", you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word, with what you did with her,
get back to me (get back to me).
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself, "why?"
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said "no", baby, and you might still have me
you can see that i've been crying
baby, you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same?
you say that the past is the past, you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said, "yes."
[chorus]
i can't resist
before you go, tell me this:
was it worth it?
was she worth this?
no... no, no, no...
[chorus]she said, i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky, the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
you never did, you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids, you and i...
oh my my my my
well, i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my...
take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a.m. riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
oh my my my my
a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me, got down on one knee
take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time, you and i
i'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky, oh my my my...i was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one-hand feel
on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around, turn the radio down
he says, "baby is something wrong?"
i say, "nothing,
i was just thinking
how we don't have a song"
and he says...
[chorus:]
our song is the slamming screen door,
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date: "man, i didn't kiss her, when i should have"
and when i got home ... 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
i was walking up
the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
and been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway,
well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice
all the roses
and the note that said...
[chorus:]
our song is the slamming screen door,
sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date: "man, i didn't kiss her, when i should have"
and when i got home ... 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
i've heard every album, listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song...
[chorus:]
'cause our song is the slamming screen door,
sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date: "man, i didn't kiss him, when i should have"
and when i got home ... 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
play it again
oh, yeah...
oh-oh, yeah.
i was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen
and an old napkin
and i wrote down our songfriday night beneath the stars,
in a field behind your yard,
you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky.
and sometimes we don't say a thing;
just listen to the crickets sing.
everything i need is right here by my side.
and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you.
[chorus:]
i'm only up when you're not down.
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
it's like no matter what i do.
well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half i'm only trying to let you know that what i feel is true.
and i'm only me when i'm with you.
just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world.
tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
and i don't try to hide my tears.
the secrets or my deepest fears.
through it all nobody gets me like you do.
and you know everything about me.
you say that you can't live without me.
[chorus]
when i'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
only you can tell.
[chorus:]
that i'm only up when you're not down.
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
it's like no matter what i do.
well you drive me crazy half the time;
the other half i'm only trying to let you know that what i feel is true.
and i'm only me
who i wanna be
well, i'm only me when i'm with you
with you
uh huh
yeahshe cant see the way your eyes
light up when you smile.
shell never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by.
and you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her
but you are everything to me.
[chorus:]
i just wanna show you
she dont even know you,
she's never gonna love you like i want to.
and you just see right through me.
if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
instead of just invisible.
theres a fire inside of you
that cant help but shine through.
shes never gonna see the light
no matter what you do.
and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be
[chorus]
like shadows in a faded light
oh, were invisible.
i just wanna open your eyes
and make you realize.
i just wanna show you
she dont even know you.
baby, let me love you,
let me want you.
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle,
unbelievable
instead of just invisible.
she cant see the way your eyes
light up when you smile.[chorus 1:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
maybe i should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall.
no matter what you say, i still can't believe
that you would walk away.
it don't make sense to me, but:
[repeat chorus 1:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
it's not unbroken anymore.
how do i get it back the way it was before?
[chorus 2:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:
[repeat chorus 1:]
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
once bitten and twice shied
i keep my distance but you still catch my eye
tell me baby
do you recognize me
well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
merry christmas, i wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying 'i love you', i meant it
now i know what a fool i've been
but if you kiss me now, i know you'd fool me again
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
a crowded room and friends with tired eyes
i'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god, i thought you were someone to rely on
me, i guess i was a shoulder to cry on
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a girl on a cover but you tore her apart
maybe this year
maybe this year i'll give it to someone special
cause last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special
and last christmas
and this year
it won't be anything like, anything like
last christmas i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone specialplease take down the misletoe
cause i don't wanna think about that right now
cause everything i want is miles away
in a snow covered little town
my momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
season's greetings, hope you're well
well i'm doing alright
if you were wondering
lately i can never tell
i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when you were mine
i've been doing fine without you, really
up until the nights got cold
and everybody's here, except you, baby
seems like everyone's got someone to hold
but for me it's just a lonely time
cause there were christmases when you were mine
merry christmas everybody
that'll have to be something i just say this year
i'll bet you got your mom another sweater
and were your cousins late again
when you were putting up the lights this year
did you notice one less pair of hands
i know this shouldn't be a lonely time
but there were christmases when i didn't wonder how you are tonight
cause there were christmases when you were mine
you were minesanta baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
i've been an awful good girl, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight
santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
well i'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
think of all the fun i've missed
think of all the boys i haven't kissed
next year i could be just as good
if you check off my christmas list
santa baby, i want a yacht and really that's not a lot
i've been an angel all year, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonight
santa, honey, there's one more thing i really do need, the deed
to a platinum mine, santa honey
so hurry down the chimney tonight
come and trim my christmas tree
with some decorations bought at tiffany's

santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
a ring
and i don't mean on the phone, santa baby
so hurry down the chimney tonightsilent night, holy night
all is calm and all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild

radiant beams from thy holy face
with the dawn of redeeming grace
jesus lord at thy birth
jesus lord at thy birth
halleluia!
halleluia!
halleluia!
christ the savior is bornwhat if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
would the song still survive without five golden rings?
would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
what would happen if god never let it snow?
what would happen if christmas carols told a lie?
tell me what would you find
you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more
what if angels did not pay attention to
all the things that we wished they would always do?
what if happiness came in a cardboard box?
then i think there is something we all forgot
what would happen if presents all went away?
tell me what would you find
you'd see that today holds something special
something holy, not superficial
so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
so here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something more
we get so caught up in all of it
business and relationships
hundred mile an hour lives
and it's this time of year
and everybody's here
it seems the last thing on your mind
is that the day holds something special
something holy, not superficial?
so here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
it's something we all try to ignore
and put a wreath up on your door
but here's something you should know that is for sure
christmas must be something
christmas must be something
christmas must be something more

now you're half way out the door
and i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called

you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to
when he said forever and always
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
i was there when you said forever and always
was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest?
made you run and hide like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute but i don't anymore
and i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to
when he said forever and always

you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to
when we said forever and always

misty morning comes again and i can't
help but wish i could see your face
and i knew from the first note played
i'd be breaking all my rules to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row scream your name
so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special, just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
good morning loneliness, comes around when i'm not
dreaming about you
when my world wakes up today
you'll be in another town
and i knew when i saw your face, i'd be
counting down the ways to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row scream your name
so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special, just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
you played in bars, you play guitar
i'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
and you'll never see, sing me to sleep
every night from the radio
so dim that spotlight, tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special, just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
sweet, sweet superstar, superstarin the heat of the fight i walked away
ignoring words that you were saying
trying to make me stay
i said, "this time i've had enough."
and you've called a hundred times
but i'm not picking up
'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over
but if you look a little closer
i said, "leave," but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming, "i'm in love with you."
wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door
me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
going through the photographs, staring at the phone
i keep going back over things we both said
and i remember the slamming door and all the things that i misread
so babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
when i left i wanted you to chase after me
yeah, i said, "leave," but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming, "i'm in love with you."
wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door
and i'll scream out the window
i can't even look at you
i don't need you but i do, i do, i do
i say, "there's nothing you can say to make this right again.
i mean it, i mean it."
what i mean is...
i said, "leave," but baby all i want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming, "i'm in love with you."
wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door
with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carry me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
after everything and that little black dress
after everything i must confess, i need youthere's somethin' 'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement
you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot
yeah
oh yeah
we're drivin' down the road
i wonder if you know
i'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absent-mindedly makin' me want you
and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
so, baby, drive slow
'til we run out of road in this one horse town
i wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it, remember it
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
well, you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
i'm not usually this way
but you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss,
it's flawless,
really something,
it's fearless.
oh yeah
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
oh-oh
oh yeahyou take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the morning of your very first day
you say "hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
"you know i haven't seen you around before."
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
feeling like there's nothing to figure out
well count to ten, take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feeling like flying
and you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
and you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin round but
in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
but i didn't know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
i've found that time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be at fifteen
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
your very first day
take a deep breath, girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.we were both young when i first saw you.
i close my eyes and the flashback starts:
i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
see you make your way through the crowd
and say, "hello, "
little did i know...
that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles,
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, "please don't go"
and i said...
romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
i'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess,
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes".
so i sneak out to the garden to see you.
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
oh, oh.
'cause you were romeo - i was a scarlet letter,
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
but you were everything to me,
i was begging you, "please don't go"
and i said...
romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
i'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess.
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes".
romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
this love is difficult but it's real.
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes".
oh, oh, oh.
i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around.
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town.
and i said...
romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone.
i keep waiting for you but you never come.
is this in my head? i don't know what to think.
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...
marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
i love you, and that's all i really know.
i talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress
it's a love story, baby, just say, "yes".
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
'cause we were both young when i first saw youhey stephen,
i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you.
and as we walked
we were talking
i didn't say half the things i wanted to.
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
hey stephen,
boy, you might have me believing
i don't always have to be alone.
[chorus:]
'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel,
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain.
so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you.
can't help it if there's no one else.
mmm, i can't help myself.
hey stephen,
i've been holding back this feeling.
so i've got some things to say to you, ha.
i seen it all
so i thought
but i never seen nobody shine the way you do.
the way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
it's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
hey stephen,
why are people always leaving?
i think you and i should stay the same.
[chorus]
they're dimming the street lights.
you're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
i'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.
hey stephen,
i could give you fifty reasons
why i should be the one you choose.
all those other girls
well, they're beautiful
but would they write a song for you?
[chorus:]
i can't help it if you look like an angel,
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain.
so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you.
can't help it if there's no one else.
mmm, i can't help myself...
...if you look like an angel.
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain.
so come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you.
can't help it if there's no one else.
mmm, i can't help myself.
myself,
can't help myself,
i can't help myself.say you're sorry
that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
'cause i honestly believed in you
holding on
the days drag on
stupid girl,
i should have known, i should have known
[chorus:]
that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town,
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
maybe i was naive,
got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake, i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams
about you and me
happy endings
now i know
[chorus:]
that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town,
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
and there you are on your knees,
begging for forgiveness, begging for me
just like i always wanted but i'm so sorry
'cause i'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
i'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
this is a big world, that was a small town
they're in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
try and catch me now
oh, it's too late
to catch me nowyou're on the phone with your girlfriend
she's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do.
i'm in the room, it's a typical tuesday night.
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
and she'll never know your story like i do.
but she wears short skirts
i wear t-shirts
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you.
been here all along.
so, why can't you see
you belong with me,
you belong with me.
walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
"hey, isn't this easy?"
and you've got a smile
that could light up this whole town.
i haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down.
you say you're fine i know you better than that.
hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
she wears high heels,
i wear sneakers.
she's cheer captain,
and i'm on the bleachers.
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you,
been here all along.
so, why can't you see
you belong with me.
standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
all this time how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me,
you belong with me.
[instrumental]
oh, i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night.
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry.
i know your favorite songs,
and you tell me about your dreams.
think i know where you belong,
think i know it's with me.
can't you see
that i'm the one
who understands you?
been here all along.
so, why can't you see
you belong with me.
standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
all this time how could you not know, baby?
you belong with me,
you belong with me.
you belong with me.
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me?
you belong with me.i see your face in my mind as i drive away,
cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
people are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
but it's killing me to see you go after all this time.
mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm
mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
it's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
now i don't know what to be without you around.
and we know it's never simple, never easy.
never a clean break, no one here to save me.
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand,
and i can't breathe without you
but i have to.
breathe without you
but i have to.
never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
every little bump in the road i tried to swerve.
people are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.
and we know it's never simple, never easy.
never a clean break, no one here to save me.
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand,
and i can't breathe without you
but i have to.
breathe without you
but i have to.
it's two a.m.
feelin' like i just lost a friend.
hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
it's two a.m.
feelin' like i just lost a friend.
hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.
and we know it's never simple, never easy.
never a clean break, no one here to save me.
ohhh
and i can't breathe without you
but i have to.
breathe without you
but i have to.
breathe without you
but i have to.
i'm sorry (oh)
i'm sorry (mmm)
i'm sorry (eh eh)
i'm sorry (mmm)
i'm sorry (eh eh)
i'm sorry (mmm)
i'm sorryi took a chance, i took a shot
and you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not
you took a swing, i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are
i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me then you cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
and here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why..
you could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
well i get so confused and frustrated
forget what i'm trying to say, oh
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me, then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why..
why..do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside
why..do you have to put down my dreams
so you're the only thing on my mind
i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me then cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i've got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes, i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doing to me
tell me why
why, tell me why
i take a step back, let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you knowall this time i was wasting,
hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances every time
and all you do is let me down
and it's taken me this long
baby but i figured you out
and you're thinking we'll be fine again,
but not this time around
you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby
like i did before
you're not sorry, no no oh
looking so innocent,
i might believe you if i didn't know
could've loved you all my life
if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
and you got your share of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know
and now you're asking me to listen
cause it's worked each time before
but you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby
like i did before
you're not sorry, no no, oh
you're not sorry no no oh
you had me crying for you honey
and it never would've gone away, no
you used to shine so bright
but i watched all of it fade
so you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone
this is the last straw
there's nothing left to beg for
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby
like i did before
you're not sorry, no no oh
you're not sorry, no no ohhe is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and it's like
i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and i'm comfortable
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breakin' down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
he can't see the smile i'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
cause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating intoxicating
complicated, got away by some mistake and now
i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
i'm so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you oh, oh
and that's the way i loved you oh, oh
never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved youonce upon a time,
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night,
you looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me
were you just kidding?
'cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby, what happened, please tell me?
'cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door
and i stare at the phone,
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest?
made you run and hide
like a scared little boy?
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute, now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything
coming down to nothing
here's to silence
that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute, but i don't anymore
and i stare at the phone,
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh, and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
you didn't mean it, baby,
i don't think so
back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?
back up, baby, back up
did you forget everything?
'cause it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
oh, i stare at the phone,
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said forever and always
and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
you didn't mean it, baby,
you said forever and always... yeahi'm five years old
it's getting cold
i've got my big coat on
i hear your laugh
and look up smiling at you
i run and run
past the pumpkin patch
and the tractor rides
look now -- the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep
on the way home
i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day
with you today
i'm thirteen now
and don't know how my friends
could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive
until we've found a town
far enough away
and we talk and window-shop
until i've forgotten all their names
i don't know who i'm gonna talk to
now at school
i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day
with you today
i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out
he's better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house
and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you
there is a video
i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen
and you're talking to me
it's the age of princesses and pirate ships
and the seven dwarfs
daddy's smart
and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side
even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
staying back and watching me shine
and i didn't know if you knew
so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day
with you todayand its a sad picture,
the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again
and you know its all the same,
another time and place
repeating history and youre getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and ill do anything to see it through
because these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah
so weve been outnumbered
raided and now cornered
its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
were getting stronger now
find things they never found
they might be bigger
but were faster and never scared
you can walk away, say we dont need this
but theres something in your eyes says we can beat this
'cause these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution, the time will come
for us to finally win
and well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
fight for what weve worked for all these years
and the battle was long, its the fight of our lives
but well stand up champions tonight
it was the night things changed
can you see it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
this revolution, throw your hands up
'cause we never gave in
and we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
hallelujahuh, oh, oh
uh, oh, oh
you were in college working part time waiting tables
left a small town, never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of fallin
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
i say, "can you believe it?"
as were lying on the couch
the moment i can see it.
yes, yes, i can see it now.
do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time.
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.
you are the best thing thats ever been mine.
flash forward and were taking on the world together,
and theres a drawer of my things at your place.
you learn my secrets and you figure out why im guarded,
you say well never make my parents mistakes.
but we got bills to pay,
we got nothing figured out,
when it was hard to take,
yes, yes, this is what i thought about.
do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
you are the best thing thats ever been mine.
do you remember all the city lights on the water?
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
you are the best thing thats ever been mine.
oh, oh, oh, oh
and i remember that fight
two-thirty am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the "goodbye."
cause thats all ive ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said, "ill never leave you alone."
you said, "i remember how we felt sitting by the water.
and every time i look at you, its like the first time.
i fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.
she is the best thing thats ever been mine."
hold on, make it last
hold on, never turn back
you made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
you are the best thing thats ever been mine.
(hold on) do you believe it?
(hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(hold on) and i can see it,
(yes, yes) i can see it now (see it now, see it now...)the way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless
that should send me runnin'
but i kinda know that i won't get far
and you stood there in front of me
just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see
what i was thinking of
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
my mind forgets to remind me
you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really something,
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be.
i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would...
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
i'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow?
i'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.
drop everything now,
meet me in the pouring rain,
kiss me on the sidewalk,
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile.
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
and the sparks fly...
oh, baby, smile...
and the sparks fly...i'm so glad you made time to see me.
how's life? tell me how's your family?
i haven't seen them in a while.
you've been good, busier than ever,
we small talk, work and the weather,
your guard is up and i know why.
because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind.
you gave me roses and i left them there to die.
so this is me swallowing my pride,
standing in front of you saying, "i'm sorry for that night,"
and i go back to december all the time.
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.
i'd go back to december, turn around and make it all right.
i go back to december all the time.
these days i haven't been sleeping,
staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
when your birthday passed and i didn't call.
and i think about summer, all the beautiful times,
i watched you laughing from the passenger side.
realized i loved you in the fall.
and then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was "goodbye".
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying, "i'm sorry for that night."
and i go back to december all the time.
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.
i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time.
i miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile,
so good to me, so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry.
maybe this is wishful thinking,
probably mindless dreaming,
but if we loved again, i swear i'd love you right.
i'd go back in time and change it but i can't.
so if the chain is on your door i understand.
but this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying, "i'm sorry for that night."
and i go back to december...
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine.
i'd go back to december, turn around and make it all right.
i'd go back to december, turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time.
all the time.i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
this is surely not what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say
[chorus:]
dont say "yes", run away now
ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
dont wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said, "speak now."
fond gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me,
you wish it was me,
dont you?
[chorus:]
dont say "yes", run away now,
ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
dont wait or say a single vow,
you need to hear me out,
and they said, "speak now."
dont say "yes", run away now,
ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
dont wait or say a single vow,
your time is running out,
and they said, "speak now."
oh, la, la
oh, oh
say a single vow
i hear the preacher say, "speak now or forever hold your peace."
theres the silence, theres my last chance.
i stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but im only looking at you.
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
[chorus:]
so, dont say "yes", run away now,
ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
dont wait or say a single vow,
you need to hear me out,
and they said, "speak now."
and you say, "lets run away now,
ill meet you when im out of my tux at the back door.
baby, i didnt say my vows,
so glad you were around
when they said, "speak now."long were the nights when
my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor wont fall through, again
and my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
and go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wonderin which version of you i might get on the phone, tonight
well i stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone.
don't you think i was too young
to be messed with?
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home, i should've known.
well maybe its me
and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe its you and your sick need
to give love then take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
and i'll look back in regret how i ignored when they said,
"run as fast as you can."
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone.
don't you think i was too young
to be messed with?
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home
dear john, i see it all now it was wrong
dont you think nineteens too young
to be played by your dark, twisted games?
when i loved you so, i should've known.
you are an expert at "sorry"
and keeping lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
cause you've burned them out
but i took your matches
before fire could catch me
so dont look now
im shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town
dear john, i see it all now that you're gone.
don't you think i was too young
to be messed with?
the girl in the dress
cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young
to be messed with?
the girl in the dress
wrote you a song, you shouldve known.
you shouldve known
dont you think i was too young?
you shouldve known.you, with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like a nothing
you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'm wounded
you, picking on the weaker man
well you can take me down with just one single blow
but you don't know, what you don't know...
someday i'll be living in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
you, with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i don't already see them
i walk with my head down
trying to block you out 'cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
'cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know, what you don't know...
someday i'll be living in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion
but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean
all you are is mean
and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
but someday i'll be living in a big ole city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so?...
someday i'll be living in a big ole city (why you gotta be so?...)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean (why you gotta be so?...)
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me (why you gotta be so?...)
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
how we met and the sparks flew instantly,
and people would say, "they're the lucky ones."
i used to know my place was the spot next to you,
now i'm searching the room for an empty seat,
'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on.
oh, a simple complication,
miscommunications lead to fall-out.
so many things that i wish you knew,
so many walls up i can't break through.
[chorus:]
now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
next chapter.
how'd we end up this way?
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
and you're doing your best to avoid me.
i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us,
how i was losing my mind when i saw you here,
but you held your pride like you should've held me.
oh, i'm scared to see the ending,
why are we pretending this is nothing?
i'd tell you i miss you but i don't know how,
i've never heard silence quite this loud.
[chorus:]
now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
this is looking like a contest,
of who can act like they care less,
but i liked it better when you were on my side.
the battle's in your hands now,
but i would lay my armor down
if you said you'd rather love than fight.
so many things that you wish i knew,
but the story of us might be ending soon.
[chorus:]
now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
and we're not speaking,
and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
i don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
the end.your little hand's wrapped around my finger
and it's so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
so i tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
to you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
i'd give all i have, honey
if you could stay like that
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up, never grow up
you're in the car on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
at 14 there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember that she's getting older too
and don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
no one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to, just try to never grow up
take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps, remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone
so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city, they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my night light on
wish i'd never grown up
i wish i'd never grown up
oh i don't wanna grow up, wish i'd never grown up
i could still be little
oh i don't wanna grow up, wish i'd never grown up
it could still be simple
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
oh darling, don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
and even though you want to, please try to never grow up
oh, don't you ever grow up
oh, never grow up, just never grow upthere i was again tonight
forcing laughter, faking smiles
same old tired lonely place
walls of insincerity,
shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you
your eyes whispered, "have we met?"
across the room your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
the lingering question kept me up
2 am, who do you love?
i wonder 'til i'm wide awake
and now i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say, "hey,
it was enchanting to meet you,
all i know is i was enchanted to meet you."
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the story line ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you
this night is sparkling, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
this night is flawless, don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love with someone else
please don't have somebody waiting on you"now go stand in the corner and think about what you did"
ha!
time for a little revenge
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
i had it all, i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you could say "sabotage"
i never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from
she's not a saint
and she's not what you think
she's an actress, whoa
she's better known
for the things that she does
on the mattress, whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't
make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge
she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
and she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
they wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
she's not a saint
and she's not what you think
she's an actress, whoa
she's better known
for the things that she does
on the mattress, whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't
make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge
i'm just another thing for you
to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him but haven't you heard
i'm just another thing for you
to roll your eyes at, honey
you might have him but i always get the last word
whoa
she's not a saint
and she's not what you think
she's an actress, whoa
she's better known
for the things that she does
on the mattress, whoa
soon she's gonna find
stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't
make you many friends
she should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge
do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'cause i don't think you do. oh.
do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
i don't think you do
i don't think you do
let's hear the applause
come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
so you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better
she took him faster than you could say "sabotage"i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your warpath
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind tryin' to get it back
wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
always a bigger bed to crawl into
wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you?
it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh, who you are is not where you've been.
you're still an innocent,
you're still an innocent.
did some things you can't speak of
but at night you live it all again
you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then
wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
when everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you?
it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh, who you are is not what you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
who you are is not what you did.
you're still an innocent.
time turns flames to embers
you'll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up too
minds change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new
it's alright, just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh, who you are is not what you've been
you're still an innocent.
it's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent.
you're still an innocent.
lost your balance on a tightrope.
it's never too late to get it back.you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and it's all too quiet
and i can't trust anything now
and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
oh, i'm holding my breath
won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted
stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time i'm wishing he was you instead
oh, i'm holding my breath
won't see you again
something keeps me holding on to nothing
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted
i know, i know, i just know
you're not gone. you can't be gone. no.
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
won't finish what you started
come on, come on, don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't go back, i'm haunted
oh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break.
never thought i'd see it...i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 1:58
the words that you whispered
for just us to know
you told me you loved me
so why did you go away?
away
i do recall now the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement
i ran off the plane
that july 9th
the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt
i can still feel your arms
but now i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party, you're showing off again
and i roll my eyes and then
you pull me in
i'm not much for dancing
but for you i did
because i love your handshake, meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions
and i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are
and i hope the sun shines
and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you
you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind
so i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name, forever the name on my lips
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last...i said remember this moment in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age
long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered
i said remember this feeling
i pass the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there
on the side-lines wishing for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming, "this is absurd!"
cause for a moment a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
i was screaming long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be remembered
hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall
will you take a moment, promise me this
that you'll stand by me forever
but if god forbid fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name
tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how i hope they shine
long live the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life, with you
long, long live the walls we crashed through
how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
and i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid
singing, long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
and long, long live the look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day, we will be rememberedelevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
but right now my time is theirs
seems like there's always someone who disapproves
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out, but my choice is you
so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours
you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine
and you'll say
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ours
and it's not theirs to speculate
if it's wrong and
your hands are tough
but they are where mine belong and
i'll fight their doubt and give you faith
with this song for you
'cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'cause my heart is yours
so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours
the stakes are high, the water's rough
but this love is ourslast night i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i'm still reaching
even though i know you're not there
i was playing back a thousand memories, baby
thinking 'bout everything we've been through
maybe i've been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you
come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
now i'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me,
"nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
not before i knew how much i had to lose."
come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
if you're out there,
if you're somewhere,
if you're moving on,
i've been waiting for you.
ever since you've been gone
i just want it back the way it was before.
and i just wanna see you back at my front door.
and i'd say
come back, come back, come back to me like
you would before you said, "it's not that easy."
before the fight, before i locked you out
but i take it all back now
come back, come back, come back to me like
you would, you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside 'til i came out
come back, come back, come back to me like
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
you'd be here by now
it's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
baby, what about the ending
oh, i thought you'd be here by now, whoa
thought you'd be here by nowtall, dark and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it's the same thing to me
he's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say, yay
and you smile and say, "how are you? "
i say, "just fine"
i always forget to tell you, i love you, i love you... forever
i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around
i watch superman fly away
come back i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down
tall, dark and beautiful
he's complicated, he's irrational
but i hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
he's not all bad like his reputation
and i can't hear one single word they say
and you'll leave, got places to be and i'll be ok
i always forget to tell you i love you, i loved you from the very first day
i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world i'll be around
i watch superman fly away
come back i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down
and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you don't save some other girl
don't forget, don't forget about me
i'm far away but i never let you go
i'm lovestruck and looking out the window
don't forget, don't forget where i'll be
right here wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you
'cause i loved you from the very first day
i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world, i'll be around...
forever and ever here
i watch superman fly away
i swear i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down
la, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la
when you come back downi'm walking fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know
is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
and i never (never) saw you coming
and i'll never (never) be the same
you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannonball
now all we know is don't let go
we are alone, just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs
four blue eyes
so you were never a saint
and ive loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild
and i never (never) {[x8:] oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
and i'll never (never) be the same
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles heel
this is the golden age of something good and right and real
and i never (never) saw you coming
and i'll never (never) be the same
and i never (never) {[x8:] oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh-ooh} saw you coming
and i'll never (never) be the same
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right[verse 1:]
loving him is like driving a new maserati down a dead-end street
faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
[chorus:]
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red
[verse 2:]
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
[chorus:]
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
oh, red
burning red
[bridge:]
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning, it was red
[chorus:]
oh, losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'cause loving him was red
yeah, yeah, red
we're burning red
[post-chorus:]
and that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
comes back to me, burning red
yeah, yeah
his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead-end streetput your lips close to mine
as long as they don't touch
out of focus, eye to eye
till the gravity's too much
and i'll do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i'd be smart to walk away,
but you're quicksand
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i, i, i like it
i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow,
but you're friction
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i, i, i like it
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you, and get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive and i would
follow you, follow you home...
i'll follow you, follow you home...
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
i, i, i... i, i, i... i, i, i...
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you, and get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should, think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive and i will
follow you, follow you home...
i'll follow you, follow you home...
i'll follow you, follow you home...
i'll follow you, follow you home...
this slope is treacherous
i, i, i like it[music video spoken part:]
i think--i think when it's all over,
it just comes back in flashes, you know?
it's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
it just all comes back. but he never does.
i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this would happen.
it's not really anything he said or anything he did,
it was the feeling that came along with it.
and the crazy thing is i don't know if i'm ever gonna feel that way again.
but i don't know if i should.
i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
but i just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
maybe he knew that when he saw me.
i guess i just lost my balance.
i think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
it was losing me.
once upon a time a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights, you got me alone
you found me, you found me, you found me
i guess you didn't care, and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard you took a step back
without me, without me, without me
and he's long gone when he's next to me
and i realize the blame is on me
'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
no apologies. he'll never see you cry,
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
you're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
now i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now i see, now i see, now i see
he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me, yeah!
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
and the saddest fear comes creeping in
that you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down, oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble
[music video spoken part:]
i don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.i walked through the door with you, the air was cold,
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house,
and you've still got it in your drawer even now.
oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
we're singing in the car, getting lost upstate.
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,
and i can picture it after all these days.
and i know it's long gone,
and that magic's not here no more,
and i might be okay,
but i'm not fine at all.
'cause there we are again on that little town street.
you almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
wind in my hair, i was there, i remember it all too well.
photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
and your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
you taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
and i know it's long gone
and there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to...
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
we're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there, i remember it all too well, yeah.
well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for too much,
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
running scared, i was there, i remember it all too well.
hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
so casually cruel in the name of being honest.
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause i remember it all, all, all... too well.
time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'cause there we are again, when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too well
wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
it was rare, i was there, i remember it all too wellit feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.
yeah,
we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
it's miserable and magical.
oh, yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
it's time
uh oh!
i don't know about you
but i'm feeling 22
everything will be alright
if you keep me next to you
you don't know about me
but i'll bet you want to
everything will be alright
if we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
it seems like one of those nights,
this place is too crowded.
too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's taylor swift anyway, ew?)
it seems like one of those nights,
we ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
instead of sleeping.
yeah,
we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
it's miserable and magical.
oh, yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
it's time
uh oh! (hey!)
i don't know about you
but i'm feeling 22
everything will be alright
if you keep me next to you
you don't know about me
but i'll bet you want to
everything will be alright (alright)
if we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
i don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
it feels like one of those nights,
we ditch the whole scene.
it feels like one of those nights,
we won't be sleeping.
it feels like one of those nights,
you look like bad news.
i gotta have you,
i gotta have you.
ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
i don't know about you (i don't know about you)
but i'm feeling 22
everything will be alright
if you keep me next to you
you don't know about me (you don't know about me)
but i'll bet you want to
everything will be alright
if we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
it feels like one of those nights,
we ditch the whole scene
it feels like one of those nights,
we won't be sleeping
it feels like one of those nights,
you look like bad news,
i gotta have you,
i gotta have you.i bet this time of night you're still up.
i bet you're tired from a long hard week.
i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
and i bet sometimes you wonder about me.
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you.
and i wish i could run to you.
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do,
i almost do.
i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
'cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
i bet it never ever occurred to you that i can't say "hello" to you
and risk another goodbye.
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you.
and i wish i could run to you.
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do,
i almost do.
oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
it's probably better off this way.
and i confess, babe,
in my dreams you're touching my face
and asking me if i wanna try again with you.
and i almost do.
and i just wanna tell you
it takes everything in me not to call you.
and i wish i could run to you.
and i hope you know that every time i don't
i almost do,
i almost do.
i bet this time of night you're still up.
i bet you're tired from a long hard week.
i bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
and i hope sometimes you wonder about me.i remember when we broke up the first time
saying, "this is it, i've had enough," 'cause like
we hadn't seen each other in a month
when you said you needed space. (what?)
then you come around again and say
"baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust me."
remember how that lasted for a day?
i say, "i hate you," we break up, you call me, "i love you."
ooh, we called it off again last night
but ooh, this time i'm telling you, i'm telling you
we are never ever ever getting back together,
we are never ever ever getting back together,
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
like, ever...
i'm really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it screaming that i'm right
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine
ooh, you called me up again tonight
but ooh, this time i'm telling you, i'm telling you
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
we are never, ever, ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
oh oh oh
i used to think that we were forever ever
and i used to say, "never say never..."
uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "i still love you,"
and i'm like... "i just... i mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
we are never getting back together. like, ever"
no!
we are never ever ever getting back together
we are never ever ever getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
we, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
we, ooh, getting back together
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
but we are never ever ever ever getting back togetheri'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
i threw my phone across the room at you.
i was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
but you stayed.
this morning i said we should talk about it.
'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
that's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "okay, let's talk."
and i said,
stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay.
before you i'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
who took all of their problems out on me.
but you carry my groceries, and now i'm always laughin'.
and i love you because you have given me no choice but to...
stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.
you took the time to memorize me:
my fears, my hopes, and dreams.
i just like hangin' out with you all the time.
all those times that you didn't leave;
it's been occurring to me i'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.
stay.
and i'll be loving you for quite some time.
no one else is gonna love me, when i get mad, mad, mad.
so i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
stay, stay, stay.
i've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
you think that it's funny when i'm mad, mad, mad.
but i think that it's best if we both stay.
[background:] that's so fun![gary lightbody:]
i find myself at your door,
just like all those times before,
i'm not sure how i got there,
all roadsthey lead me here.
i imagine you are home,
in your room, all alone,
and you open your eyes into mine,
and everything feels better,
[both:]
and right before your eyes,
i'm breaking, no past
no reasons why,
just you and me.
this is the last time i'm asking you this,
put my name at the top of your list,
this is the last time i'm asking you why,
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.
[taylor swift:]
you find yourself at my door,
just like all those times before,
you wear your best apology,
but i was there to watch you leave,
and all the times i let you in,
just for you to go again,
disappear when you come back,
everything is better.
[both:]
and right before your eyes,
i'm aching, no past
nowhere to hide,
just you and me...
this is the last time i'm asking you this,
put my name at the top of your list,
this is the last time i'm asking you why,
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...
[taylor swift:] this is the last time you tell me i've got it wrong,
[gary lightbody:] this is the last time i say it's been you all along,
[taylor swift:] this is the last time i let you in my door,
[gary lightbody:] this is the last time, i won't hurt you anymore.
oh, oh, oh,
this is the last time i'm asking you this,
put my name at the top of your list,
this is the last time i'm asking you why,
you break my heart in the blink of an eye.
[4x:]
this is the last time i'm asking you,
last time i'm asking you,
last time i'm asking you this...i was reminiscing just the other day,
while having coffee all alone and lord, it took me away.
back to a first-glance feeling on new york time.
back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
took off faster than a green light "go".
yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
i left a note on the door with a joke wed made,
and that was the first day.
and darling, it was good never looking down.
and right there where we stood was holy ground.
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
we had this big wide city all to ourselves.
we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you,
and for the first time i had something to lose,
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way.
and the storys got dust on every page,
but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now.
and i see your face in every crowd.
cause darling, it was good never looking down.
and right there where we stood was holy ground.
tonight im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you.
tonight im gonna dance like you were in this room.
but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you,
it was good never looking down.
and right there where we stood was holy ground.
tonight im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
but i dont wanna dance if im not dancing with you.
tonight im gonna dance like you were in this room.

how you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.

it was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight
like we're made of starlight
i met bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
picked me up late one night out the window,
we were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
the night we snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince
and i said, "oh my, what a marvelous tune."
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight
he said, "look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
you'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?"
like "oh my, what a marvelous tune."
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight
ooh ooh he's talking crazy
ooh ooh dancing with me
ooh ooh we could get married
have ten kids and teach them how to dream
oh my, what a marvelous tune
it was the best night, never would forget how he moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines,
and we were dancing, dancing
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we're made of starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
like starlight, starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
don't you see the starlight, starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn't get this song
but i do, i do
walked in expecting you'd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you don't know how nice that is
but i do
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you said you never met one girl
who had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm coming off a little shy
but i do
but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
and we walked down the block to my car and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies that your family
watches
every single christmas and i want to talk about that
and for the first time what's past is past
'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin againyou should've been there,
should've burst through the door,
with that 'baby i'm right here' smile,
and it would've felt like,
a million little shining stars had just aligned,
and i would've been so happy.
christmas lights glisten,
i've got my eye on the door,
just waiting for you to walk in,
but the time is ticking,
people ask me how i've been
as i comb back through my memory,
how you said you'd be here,
you said you'd be here.
and it was like slow motion,
standing there in my party dress,
in red lipstick,
with no one to impress,
and they're all laughing,
as i'm looking around the room,
but there's one thing missing,
and that was the moment i knew.
and the hours pass by,
now i just wanna be alone,
but your close friends always seem to know
when there's something really wrong,
so they follow me down the hall,
and there in the bathroom,
i try not to fall apart,
and the sinking feeling starts,
as i say hopelessly,
"he said he'd be here."
and it was like slow motion,
standing there in my party dress,
in red lipstick,
with no one to impress,
and they're all laughing,
and asking me about you,
but there was one thing missing,
and that was the moment i knew.
what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know?
and what do you do when the one
who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show?
you should've been here.
and i would've been so happy.
and it was like slow motion,
standing there in my party dress,
in red lipstick,
with no one to impress,
and they're all standing around me singing
"happy birthday to you",
but there was one thing missing,
and that was the moment i knew.
ooh, i knew.
ooh,
you called me later,
and said, "i'm sorry, i didn't make it,"
and i said, "i'm sorry too,"
and that was the moment i knew.you said it in a simple way,
4 am, the second day,
how strange that i don't know you at all.
stumbled through the long goodbye,
one last kiss, then catch your flight,
right when i was just about to fall
i told myself, "don't get attached,"
but in my mind i play it back,
spinning faster than the plane that took you...
and this is when the feeling sinks in,
i don't wanna miss you like this,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
i guess you're in new york today,
i don't wanna need you this way,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
the delicate beginning rush,
the feeling you can know so much,
without knowing anything at all.
and now that i can't put this down,
if i had known what i'd known now,
i never would have played so nonchalant.
taxi cabs and busy streets,
that never bring you back to me,
i can't help but wish you took me with you...
and this is when the feeling sinks in,
i don't wanna miss you like this,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
i guess you're in london today,
i don't wanna need you this way,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
this is falling in love in the cruelest way,
this is falling for you when you are worlds away.
new york... be here.
but you're in london and i break down,
'cause it's not fair that you're not around.
this is when the feeling sinks in,
i don't wanna miss you like this,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
i guess you're in new york today,
and i don't wanna need you this way,
come back... be here, come back... be here.
i don't wanna miss you like this.
come back... be here.
come back... be here.don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that.
i don't even know her,
but i feel a responsibility,
to do what's upstanding and right,
it's kinda like a code, yeah,
and you've been getting closer and closer,
and crossing so many lines.
and it would be a fine proposition,
if i was a stupid girl,
but honey i am no-one's exception,
this i have previously learned.
so don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
i see you turn off your phone,
and now you got me alone,
and i say,
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that.
i just wanna make sure,
you understand perfectly,
you're the kind of man who makes me sad,
while she waits up,
you chase down the newest thing,
and take for granted what you have.
and it would be a fine proposition,
if i was a stupid girl,
and yeah i might go with it,
if i hadn't once been just like her.
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
i see you turn off your phone,
and now you've got me alone,
and i say,
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that.
call a cab,
lose my number,
you're about to lose your girl,
call a cab,
lose my number,
let's consider this lesson learned.
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
wanna see you pick up your phone,
and tell her you're coming home,
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that,
uh, uh
don't look at me,
you've got a girl at home,
and everybody knows that,
everybody knows that.
it would be a fine proposition,
if i hadn't once been just like her.walking through a crowd
the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud
heartbeats under coats
everybody here
wanted something more
searching for a sound we hadn't
heard before
and it said

new money, suit and tie
i can read you like a magazine
ain't it funny, rumors fly
and i know you heard about me
so hey, let's be friends
i'm dying to see how this one ends
grab your passport and my hand
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend
so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless
or with a nasty scar
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i've got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name
cherry lips, crystal skies
i could show you incredible things
stolen kisses, pretty lies
you're the king, baby, i'm your queen
find out what you want
be that girl for a month
wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
screaming, crying, perfect storms
i can make all the tables turn
rose garden filled with thorns
keep you second guessing like
"oh my god, who is she?"
i get drunk on jealousy
but you'll come back each time you leave
'cause, darling, i'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
so it's gonna be forever
or it's gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when it's over
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
'cause you know i love the players
and you love the game
'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you breathless
or with a nasty scar
got a long list of ex-lovers
they'll tell you i'm insane
but i've got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your name
boys only want love if it's torture
don't say i didn't say, i didn't warn ya

but i've got a blank space, baby
and i'll write your namemidnight,
you come and pick me up, no headlights
a long drive,
could end in burning flames or paradise
fade into view, oh, it's been a while since i have even heard from you (heard from you)
i should just tell you to leave 'cause i
know exactly where it leads but i
watch us go 'round and 'round each time
you got that james dean daydream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style
we never go out of style
you got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style
we never go out of style.
so it goes
he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
takes me home
lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
i say, "i heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."
he says, "what you've heard is true but i
can't stop thinking about you," and i...
i said, "i've been there, too, a few times."
'cause you got that james dean daydream look in your eye
and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style
we never go out of style
you got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
and i got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style

and i got that red lip classic thing that you like
and when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'cause we never go out of style
we never go out of stylelooking at it now
it all seems so simple
we were lying on your couch
i remember
you took a polaroid of us
then discovered (then discovered)
the rest of the world was black and white
but we were in screaming color
and i remember thinking
[chorus 2x:]
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods?
are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet?
are we in the clear yet?
in the clear yet?
good
are we out of the woods?
looking at it now
last december (last december)
we were built to fall apart
then fall back together (back together)
your necklace hanging from my neck
the night we couldn't quite forget
when we decided (we decided)
to move the furniture so we could dance,
baby, like we stood a chance
two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
and i remember thinkin'
[chorus 2x]
(are we out of the woods?!)
remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
twenty stitches in the hospital room
when you started cryin', baby, i did, too
but when the sun came up, i was lookin' at you
remember when we couldn't take the heat
i walked out and said, "i'm settin' you free,"
but the monsters turned out to be just trees
and when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
you were lookin' at me
you were lookin' at me,
i remember, oh, i remember
[chorus 4x]people like you always want back the love they gave away
and people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
the more i think about it now the less i know
all i know is that you drove us off the road

hey, all you had to do was stay
had me in the palm of your hand
then why'd you have to go and lock me out when i let you in
stay, hey, now you say you want it

all you had to do was stay
here you are now, calling me up, but i don't know what to say
i've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
people like you always want back the love they pushed aside
but people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

and you were too afraid to tell her what you want.

and i could go on and on, on and on, and i will
skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
and you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
in silent screams,
in wildest dreams
i never dreamed of this
this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
and i could go on and on, on and on
lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
but you're still gone, gone, gone
been losing grip,
oh, sinking ships
you showed up just in time
this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]
your kiss, my cheek, i watched you leave
your smile, my ghost, i fell to my knees
when you're young you just run
but you come back to what you need
this love is good, this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]you stand with your hand on my waist line
it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it's a bad sign, bad sign
something happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circling dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
it could burn out
cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
and guns
they are the hunters, we are the foxes
and we run
baby, i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
cause i, i know places we can hide
i know places, i know places
lights flash and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want, we won't hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
my love
they are the hunters, we are the foxes
and we run
baby, i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
cause i, i know places we can hide
i know places
they are the hunters, we are the foxes
and we run
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
my love
baby, i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
cause i, i know places we can hide
i know places
they take their shots, but we're bulletproof
i know places
and you know for me, it's always you
i know places
in the dead of night, your eyes so green
i know places
and i know for you, it's always me
i know placesthe drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
it was months, and months of back and forth
you're still all over me like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore
hung my head as i lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you,
i think i am finally clean
there was nothing left to do
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning, gone was any trace of you,
i think i am finally clean
i think i am finally clean
said i think i am finally clean
10 months sober, i must admit
just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, i won't give in
now that i'm clean i'm never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you,
i think i am finally clean
rain came pouring down when i was drowning
that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
finally clean
think i'm finally clean
think i'm finally cleanflashing lights and we
took a wrong turn and we
fell down a rabbit hole.
you held on tight to me
'cause nothing's as it seems
i'm spinning out of control.
didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
oh
didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twisting around me
i should have slept with one eye open at night.
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever
eh

and life was never worse but never better
eh eh

so we went on our way
too in love to think straight
all alone or so it seemed.
but there were strangers watching
and whispers turned to talking
and talking turned to screams.
oh
didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
didn't you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile?
oh
didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twisting around me
it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.
but darling, we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever

i reached for you but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
and in the end in wonderland we both went mad.
oh

and we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
eh eh

in wonderlandone look, dark room
meant just for you
time moved too fast
you play it back
buttons on a coat
lighthearted joke
no proof, not much
but you saw enough
small talk, he drives
coffee at midnight
the light reflects
the chain on your neck
he says look up
and your shoulders brush
no proof, one touch
you felt enough
you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you are in love
morning, his place
burn toast, sunday
you keep his shirt
he keeps his word
and for once you let go
of your fears and your ghosts
one step, not much
but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks
you fight and you talk
one night he wakes
strange look on his face
pauses, then says
you're my best friend
and you knew what it was
he is in love
you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
and so it goes
you two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
and he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in love
you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in love
you can hear it in the silence, silence
you can feel it on the way home, way home
you can see it with the lights out, lights out
you are in love, true love
you're in lovewe're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
we wait for trains that just aren't coming
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me, mine is better
we're so young but we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey, life is just a classroom
'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby, we're the new romantics
come on, come along with me
heart break is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free
we're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
we hang back, it's all in the timing
it's poker, he can't see it in my face
but i'm about to play my ace
we need love, but all we want is danger
we team up then switch sides like a record changer
the rumors are terrible and cruel
but, honey, most of them are true
'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby, we're the new romantics
come on, come along with me
heart break is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancing
to get knocked off our feet
baby, we're the new romantics
the best people in life are free
so come on, come along with me
the best people in life are free
please take my hand and
please take me dancing and
please leave me stranded,
it's so romantic
'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
'cause, baby, i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me

the way you love with all you have,
there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
once i thought that love was something i could never do
never knew that i could feel this much
but this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
is more than a reaction to your touch
it's a perfect passion and i can't get enough
the way you look, the way you laugh,
the way you love with all you have,
there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
the way you kiss, the way you cry,

in my life i've been hammered by some heavy blows
that never knocked me off my feet
all you gotta do is smile at me and down i go
and baby it's no mystery why i surrender

the way you love with all you have,
there ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
the way you kiss, the way you cry,
the way you move when you walk by
there ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
that don't do something for me

it's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

and a car up on blocks in the driveway
the moment we meet, there was never a doubt
that we won't forget this sunday
it starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
and it all leads to this - our first kiss
all my friends are saying
girl, what are you thinking?
you're better off,
you're better off without him
find yourself another
girl, that boy is trouble
you're better off, you're better off
they can talk forever, they just don't know better
we drive around town in a rusty old truck
somehow it feels like we're flying
don't wanna come down
but they make it so tough
'cause everyone we know is trying
to push us apart hide it down in our hearts
and they get what they want cause you're gone
all my friends are saying
girl, why are you crying?
you're better off, you're better off without him
find yourself another
girl, that boy is trouble
you're better off, you're better off
they can talk forever, they just don't know better
you come to my door
in the pouring rain
we know what we don't have to say
you hand me a rose and a note that says
we don't have to do things their way
all my friends are saying
girl, what are you thinking?
you're better off, you're better off without him
find yourself another
girl, that boy is trouble
you're better off, you're better off
well, they can talk forever, they just don't know betterhere you are now
fresh from your war
back from the edge of time
and all that you were
stripped to the bone
i thought you'd want to know
that when you feel the world is crashing
all around your feet
come running headlong into my arms
breathless
i'll never judge you
i can only love you
come now running headlong
into my arms
breathless
lay down your guns
too weak to run
nothing can harm you here
your precious heart
broken and scarred
somehow you made it through
i only ask that you won't go again
when you feel the world is crashing
all around your feet
come running headlong into my arms
breathless
i'll never judge you
i can only love you
come now running headlong
into my arms
breathless
i'm so glad to see you smiling
so good to hear your laugh
i think that you've found you even
missed yourself
i'm only asking this because i think that
truth be told
oh, you'll never go again
again
when you feel the world is crashing
all around your feet
come running headlong into my arms
breathless
i'll never judge you
i can only love you
come now running headlong
into my arms
breathless
breathlessemily comes home from school,
grabs onto her daddy's hand,
he says, "baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
she says, "please, don't make me go back there again."
she said, "i wish there was some way
to make them stop it."
so he drives down to
that principles office and says,
"i didn't bring her up
so they could cut her down.
i didn't bring her here
so they could shut her out.
i live my whole damn life
to see that little girl's smile.
so why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
she wasn't brought up that way."
emily's home late again
he sees that boy drive away
oh, but something's different this time,
she doesn't have too much to say
she said, "he tried but there's just some things i won't do."
and through the tears she said, "i couldn't do that to you."
and he said,
"i didn't bring you up
so he could wear you down.
take that innocent heart
and turn it inside out.
i live my whole damn life
to see my little girl's smile.
so don't let nobody take that away.
you weren't brought up that way."
the phone rings on a rainy night
says, "it's officer tate."
he said, "sir, there's been an accident.
you better come down here right away.
a drunken driver missed an over pass.
and emily  she's fading fast."
he says, "god, i didn't bring her up
to watch them lay her down.
nearly killed me the day
they put her momma in the ground.
only thing that kept me alive
was that little girl's smile.
so please don't take that away.
it won't be easy taking her today.
she wasn't brought up that way."
he stands over the hospital bed
emily opens her eyesi had to catch my breath
when i saw you there across the room
holding her hand
i'd have never guessed
that starting over would look so good on you
but here i am
still believing there might come a day
we'll pick up where we left off
and by the way
your eyes are dancing
i'd say the chances of that are getting slim
by the way
my heart's still breaking
it's gonna take it a while to love again
so many things that i forgot to say
by the way
i should've let you know
all the ways you made me feel alive
i guess it's too late
so i'll just get my coat
and make my way into this breezy night
give you one last wave
maybe you'll drop what you're doing
and come over here to say
i'm looking good
but by the way
your eyes are dancing
i'd say the chances of that are getting slim
by the way
my heart's still breaking
it's gonna take it a while to love again
so many things that i forgot to say
by the way
you still look amazing
and i must've been crazy to let you get away
by the way
if you ever wondered
still got the same old number; just in case
i still miss you
and i still love you
by the way
by the way, ohany day now, they're talking war
i can see the look that's in your eyes
they're not talking a week or two
oh, daddy can i go with you?
oh, daddy can i go with you?
you pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
i always knew this time would come
when i ask how long you think you're gonna be
you say, this crazy world's come undone
summer's over and leaves begin to fall
and another winter's on the way
i knew i wasn't gonna take this very well
but i'd give anything to have you here today
everyday now they're talking war
& i know this time is like it's never been before
we're not talking about a week or two
oh, daddy can i go with you?
oh, daddy can i go with you?
oh, daddy can i go with you?i drive around this town
in a mustang with the top down
and six running horses under my hood
well thats good enough for me
dont need the real thing
thats just another thing
for me to try to tame
dont know if i could
it might just break me
i thought there for a little while
every sunset id be a riding off with him
snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
thats the closest youll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
thats the closest to a cowboy
youll see me
before i met him
i was so sane and grounded
before he taught me how to lie
and crawl out the window
i learned the dirt roads
and i got my heart broken
cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
and how to let go
i thought there for a little while
every sunset id be a riding off with him
snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
thats the closest youll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
thats the closest to a cowboy
youll see me
it was all a little
wonderful and strange
but ill never look
at a sunset the same night
snap buttons on a denim shirt
blue jeans and a little dirt
thats the closest youll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
sitting fishing by the river bank
swimming in the water tank
thats the closest youll see me
feet hanging out a pickup truck
crazy and a little rough
running free
thats the closest to a cowboy
youll see mei'd never gone with the wind
just let it flow
let it take me where it wants to go
'til you open the door
there's so much more
i'd never seen it before
i was trying to fly
but i couldn't find wings
but you came along and you changed everything
[chorus:]
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm falling and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier
i've watched from a distance as you made life your own
every sky was your own kind of blue
and i wanted to know how that would feel
and you made it so real
you showed me something that i couldn't see
you opened my eyes
and you made me believe
[chorus]
baby you showed me what living is for
i don't wanna hide anymore
oh oh
you lift my feet off the ground
you spin me around
you make me crazier, crazier
feels like i'm fallin' and i am lost in your eyes
you make me crazier, crazier, crazier
crazier, crazier.ive been counting days and

in a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
i'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
he hangs up the phone and she whispers back,
missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here, today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee
he was lying when he said he moved to l.a.
he's just hiding out on the other side of town
with his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
he's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,
missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here, today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee
she almost called him on the night that he wrote
these simple words on his goodbye note
missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
won't you come back to me?
i'll be here, today and here tomorrow
in dark blue tennessee
in dark blue tennesseeshe walks to school with her arms crossed
it's just another day
at 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
then finally she sees them
it's scary how things change
and i saw the story on the news
i saw the footage from the roof
i sat down and cried
didn't she call you?
didn't she need you bad enough?
was there some reason i'm not aware of?
did you not write it down
just one more thing to do
where were you
and didn't she pray too
he kissed his wife good bye
and took the earliest flight
so he could be home that night
to put his kids to sleep
down the aisle three men walked and said,
"we're here to die for our god."
he stood up and said, "that's funny,
'cause my god died for me."
i put the magazine down
i read his words out loud
i sat down and cried
didn't he call you?
didn't he need you bad enough?
was there some reason i'm not aware of?
did you not write it down?
just one more thing to do
where were you?
and didn't he pray too?
the taxis pulled up on the very day of
they rode 100 floors up just to come back down
they never thought they'd see the day
that the towers up in flames
there was nothing left to say when it all came down
and didn't they call you?
didn't they need you bad enough?
was there some reason i'm not aware of?
did you not write it down?
just one more thing to do
where were you? where were you?
and didn't they pray too?
i walk to school and i wear a cross
i'm counting every daymy momma stood across the room
face to face but never eye to eye
recalling words we said
the battle that we swore
we'd never fight
breaking pieces off with every lie
a tear came to her eye
and she said
don't walk away now
and don't rip my heart out
don't you block me out tonight
honey where are you?
and don't hate me for loving you
he walked around my life
and made blind
with every single move
he caught me staring at him
mad about him
little that i knew
love is different
when you play the fool
and all i wanna do is say
don't walk away now
and don't rip my heart out
don't you make cry tonight
like you always do
and don't hate me for loving you
i slammed the door
sat on the floor
cried into my bed
said are you there?
do you even care?
to cross above my head
but someone said
don't turn away now
and don't rip my heart out
things are meant to happen like this
i know it's right for you
and don't hate me for loving you
i looked up at the sky
face to face and finally
eye to eyehere in my mind the sky looks the same
on every day you loved me
when we started home it started to rain
you put your coat around me
we stood there in the road
you held me so close
but did you ever let go
down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
right here right now, i feel it on my skin
the bitter sting of what we couldve been
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain
in through the window i see her with you
im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry
i guess the storm is over for you
but look at the tears here in my eyes
i just stood there like a ghost
as you held her so close
and as i let you go
down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
love like this changes who you are
every kiss you gave me is a scar
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain
all i need is to move on fast
but all i want is to have you back
and it just keeps falling
down came the rain
lightning and thunder
we tried in vain
to hold on to each other
winds of change blew you away from me
right here right now, i feel it on my skin
the bitter sting of what we couldve been
just when our love was like a burning flame
down came the rain
down came the rain[spoken:] you know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

even when you're sleeping
keep your ey-eyes open
the tricky thing
is yesterday we were just children
playing soldiers
just pretending
dreaming dreams with happy endings
in backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
but now we've stepped into a cruel world
where everybody stands and keeps score

everybody's waiting for you to break down
everybody's watching to see the fallout
even when you're sleeping, sleeping
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
so here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
every lesson forms a new scar
they never thought you'd make it this far
but turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
it's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
but you've got something they don't
yeah you've got something they don't
you've just gotta keep your eyes open

having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
uh oh, uh oh,

and we'll tell each other things like i need you
you and me

i may see
there are people you just come back to
so fall back on me
fall back on you

i may see
there are people who you come back to
so fall back on me,

all i could see was you and i.
i was captivated.
a perfect little dream inside my head,
and then reality crept in, and erased it.
for a while i thought that i could hold you,
but you were just a temporary high.
firefly you drew me to you,
your beauty shines and lights up the sky
and you don't know it, do you?
i wish i could keep you, firefly
firefly
something so beautiful and free,
was as never meant to be caged in
i thought i had you in my hand,

he just said me and gracie will come and take him on
there's a whole a lot of good people in heaven

and i know there's a god because i met him
and i see it when i'm looking at you
there ain't no accidents in what we do
and the people that we meet
as we go through the rain
there are no accidents in what we dowish i had concentrated,
they said love was complicated,
but it's something i just fell into,
and it was over-rated
but just look what i've created
i came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue
before you ask me if i'm alright,
think about what i,
had to do-oo, yeah
wake up and smell the break-up
fix my heart, put on my make-up
another mess i didn't plan,
and i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me,
wish you could only see,
i've got an i heart question mark,
written on the back of my hand.
i'd be fine if you just walked by,
but you had to talk about why,
you were wrong and i was right,
but i can't believe you made me,
sit at home and cry like a baby,
wait right by the phone every night,
and now you ask about you and i,
there's no you and i,
remember what you put me through,
i had to,
wake up and smell the break-up,
fix my heart put on my make-up,
another mess i didn't plan,
and i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
i wish you'd could only see
i got an i heart question mark,
written on the back of my hand
and when you're home alone at night,
you'll still wonder
why you took everything i had, oh baby
i had a lot about you and i,
there's no you and i,
and i know,
someday you will...
wake up and smell the break-up,
realize that we won't make-up
it didn't go the way you planed,
and you'll know you didn't beat me,
when you look down and see,
i've got an i heart question mark
written on the back of my hand,
written on the back of my hand
an i heart question mark, yeah
written on the back of my hand[taylor swift:]

didn't matter where i'd been
'cause i'd seen the sky
i wanna tell you why
but somehow i know i
would break down and cry
i know you can't see me here
but i am not alone
i'm lying here in invisible arms
and i won't be alone tonight
you... you know i would die
before i let them see me
see me cry
please don't leave tonight
oh let me down slowly
show me a light
i know you can't see me here
but i am not alone
i'm lying here in invisible arms
and i won't be alone tonight
oh let me think i'm strong
please don't bring me down
i need you tonight
i know you can't see me here
but i am not alone
i'm lying here in invisible arms
and i won't be alone tonight
i... i used to fly
didn't matter where i'd been
'cause i'd seen the skythrowing pennies at the fountain,
when you're standing on a mountain,
it's kinda hard to aim.
but like the trees we cut our names in,
there must be an explanation,
guess it didn't given off rain.
i need reasons why you're leaving
[chorus:]
well i guess i wished on a plane,
i thought was a star,
i guess what you wrote on a paper
wasn't really from your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess heard you wrong
and i guess i wished on a plane
and i thought was a star.
diving off into the deep end,
honestly believe you'd be there,
when i jumped in,
is ain't your territory,
we had the perfect love story,
except ending.
nothing comes true,
when it comes to you.
[chorus:]
well i guess i wished on a plane,
i thought was a star,
i guess what you wrote on a paper
wasn't really from your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess heard you wrong
and i guess i wished on a plane
and i thought it was a star.
and i was too cloudy,
it's not my fault i just couldn't see.
[chorus:]
well i guess i wished on a plane,
i thought it was a star,
i guess what you wrote on a paper
wasn't really in your heart
could've sworn you said you loved me
i guess heard you wrong
and i guess i wished on a plane
and i thought it was a star.
throwing pennies at the fountain,
when you're standing on a mountain,
it's kinda hard to aim.i dont think that passenger seat
has ever looked this good to me
he tells me about his night
and i count the colors in his eyes
hell never fall in love he swears
as he runs his fingers through his hair
im laughing 'cause i hope he's wrong
and i don't think it ever crossed his mind
he tells a joke, i fake a smile
but i know all his favorite songs
and...
[chorus:]
i could tell you his favorite color's green
he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
his sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
and if you asked me if i love him,
id lie
he looks around the room
innocently overlooks the truth
shouldnt a light go on?
doesnt he know that ive had him memorized for so long?
he sees everything black and white
never let nobody see him cry
i dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine
[chorus]
he stands there, then walks away
my god if i could only say,
"im holding every breath for you..."
hed never tell you but he can play guitar
i think he can see through everything but my heart
first thought when i wake up
is "my god, hes beautiful."
so i put on my make-up
and pray for a miracle
yes, i could tell you his favorite color's green
he loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
his sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes
and if you asked me if i love him
if you asked me if i love him
id lieshe didn't have a reason to go, oh no
she didn't have a reason to stay
either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
she looked at her keys and found a reason to run
and time stands still when you're nowhere bound
but i understand it somehow
if i could drive all night would i find my peace of mind?
would it be a million miles of cold white lies
and unfamiliar exit signs?
i just drive on by, just south of knowing why
i didn't really know her that well
but i could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
she felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much
if you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough
and time stands still when you're nowhere bound
that's where i'm headed right now
if i could drive all night would i find my peace of mind?
would it be a million miles of cold white lies
and unfamiliar exit signs?
i just drive on by, just south of knowing why
i don't have a plan, i don't have a map
i don't even know if i'm ever going back
i don't have a when and i don't have a where
i don't even know if i'll know when i'm there
but if i could drive all night would i find my peace of mind?
would it be a million miles of cold white lies
and unfamiliar exit signs?
i just drive on by
i just drive on by, drive on, drive on
drive all night
if i drive on, drive on, drive on
drive all night, just south of knowing whyi got a lying smile i never put out for you
cause i guess i never felt like i really needed to
and they say little girls have big dreams
and nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing it'd be a long time going
they say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
and i say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
and they say little girls are so naive
that wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you
and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing it will be a long time going
i've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
washed my sins on the neon lights
and i'm still not over you
and it was a long time coming
i waited half my life just to find someone like you
i spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
not knowing it will be a long time going
a long time going
and it will be a long time, long time going
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
it will be a long time, long time going, going
oh-oh, oh-oh, ohcome on, gather 'round, i'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
sorry for the inconvenience, i didn't mean to let you down
we were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
you were the perfect view of misery
i never talked about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never talked about the days he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
but in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose
let's talk about that golden boy that i met on a winter night
how was i supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
he smiled and i smiled, well the camera's in your mind
and i lied, i swore that everything was fine
i never talked about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never talked about the nights he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
but in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose
i know you wanna talk about me
how i gave up on love so foolishly
but keep in mind
i never talked about the tears i cried
all the sleepless nights or the endless fights
i never talked about the nights he called
there was something wrong, it was all my fault
i had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
but in case you haven't heard the news
there wasn't much love to lose
come on, gather 'round, i'm gonna tell you how the fire went outthere's a little girl in this little town
with a little too much heart to go around
live forever, never say never
you could do better, that's what she says
mama named her lucky on a starlit night
a rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
of the fact that she's different
and yet she's the same
and she says lucky you, lucky you
she sings her little song, she walks along
a little pathway headed for the skies
left to travels, lives they unravel
mind over matter, that's what she says
mama named her lucky on a starlit night
a rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
of the fact that she's different
and yet she's the same
and she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you
maybe she'll sing you do do do do
maybe she'll bring you into the skies
honey she'll love you, funny how some view
angels above you ain't so far away
mama named her lucky on a starlit night
a rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
of the fact that she's different
and yet she's the same
and she says lucky you, lucky youyour feet under the table
i love it when they're touching mine
your hands make the crisps at the cradle
to tell me everything is fine
all i see is you looking at me
do you know when you go
you make the sweetest sight at the window
if you had never come out of the blue
i would have stayed up and made up you
you smile just like a picture
it doesn't even need a frame
sometimes i wait to answer
just to hear you say my name
and all i want is just what i've got
do you know when you go
you make the sweetest sight at the window
if you had never come out of the blue
i would have stayed up and made up you
i'd never let you go
even if i could
cause i never could've dreamed you up this good
oh oh
do you know when you go
you make the sweetest sight at the window
if you had never come out of the blue
i would have stayed up and made up you
made up you
oh oh
made up youhe's got a nice little life
he's gonna live it, but on
friday nights he plays that mandolin
painted red, and he said
it's not the best i know
but it's mine, i'm gonna make it mine
people there can't help but care
about the friendly music of a guy
who's getting by from their applause
he's got a song that moves along
he's got his local crowd tonight
at angelina's family bar and grill
he's got his heart on his sleeve
the songs he plays just living free
but who knows what goes through his mind
when he plays a song it brings along
everybody saying
who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
oh yeah, mandolin
got a car, got a scar
like everyone he's got a few but
everybody loves that mandolin
got his problems, bills to pay
somehow that boy finds a way
through paychecks in tip jars, yeah
he's got his heart on his sleeve
the songs he plays just living free
but who knows what goes through his mind
when he plays a song it brings along
everybody saying
who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
oh yeah, mandolin
oh he's the kind of guy
who never really wanted fame
his feet are planted firmly on the ground
he never wanted people to remember his name
he never wanted word to get around
that he found heaven on earth
he's got his heart on his sleeve
the songs he plays just living free
but who knows what goes through his mind
when he plays a song it brings along
everybody saying
who's that guy who plays the mandolin
oh, i'm the guy who plays the mandolin
mandolin
oh, mandolinme and britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
in the summer shade
she said she was gonna be a movie star
and i said she was crazy
catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
just me and britney
oh, oh
we were babies, we were beautiful and free
oh, oh
there was nothing that was out of reach
for me and britney
she never made it to hollywood but she made it to memphis
and this little old town just hasnt been the same since
that boy she went ran off with, well i thought he was crazy
maybe i was just jealous that he'd come between me and britney
oh, oh
she was in love, she was beautiful and free
oh, oh
she was always so much braver than me
when the phone rang in the middle of the night
before she said a word i knew it was her
she said im sorry for waking you up but i didnt know who else to call
or where else to go
me and britney sat down on the front porch
talking about love and how it changes things
changes people and it changes names and everything but me and britney
oh, oh
were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
oh, oh
even when were old, were still gonna be
me and britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shadei like glitter and sparkly dresses,
but i'm not gonna talk about that
in my monologue
i like baking and things that smell like winter,
but i'm not gonna talk about that
in my monologue
la la la, la la la
i like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
but i'm not gonna say that
in my monologue
i like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
but i'm not gonna say that
in my monologue
la la, la la la la la
this is my musical monologue
you might think i'd bring up joe,
the guy who broke up with me on the phone,
but i'm not gonna mention him
in my monologue
hey joe! i'm doing real well,
tonight i'm hosting snl
but i'm not gonna brag about that
in my monologue
la la la, ha ha ha
ha ha ha, ha ha ha
la la la
and if you're wondering if i might,
be dating the werewolf from twilight,
(hi taylor!)
i'm not gonna comment on that
in my monologue
la la, la la la la la
this is my musical monologue
you might be expecting me to say
something bad about kanye
and how he ran up on the stage
and ruined my vma monologue.....
but there's nothing more to say
cause everything's okay
i've got security lining this stage
this is my snl monologue
la la, la la la la la
this is my snl monologue
la la, la la la la la
that was my snl monologuei know we've got a lot to say
between now and forever
but i'd be a game if you would play
and my dear you get better
all throughout the day
you smile and walk away
all i can think to do
is follow you
if you leave i'll be crawling back for more
if you need love i'll be standing at your door
i'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure
wherever you think i am tonight
just know we're miles from a heartbreak
because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
i'll be right where you are baby
sometime along the way you take my breath away
distracted by he view
i fall right into you
and if you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love i'll be standing at your door
i'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
they say i need to see all the people out there waiting
but you take one look at me
and i know the mistake i'd be making
cuz if you ever leave i'll be crawling back for more
and if you ever need love i'm standing at your door
i'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure
i know we've got a lot to say between now and foreversomething about me didn't fit into your perfect world
i bet the bluegrass stained your smile
you should use a darker color when you write on the wall
i haven't read it a thousand times
maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
honey i was trying so hard
to talk, walk, think, stop
anytime you want me to
bend all my rules
i used to let you choose
who you wanted me to be
this time i'm flying free
it's my turn to be me
you liked the face but you had to replace me
inside i saw the walls of me go down
you can take the girl away from
cowboy hats and steel guitars
she'll still sing the same old songs
maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
honey i was trying so hard
to talk, walk, think, stop
anytime you want me to
bend all my rules
i used to let you choose
who you wanted me to be
this time i'm flying free
it's my turn to be me
turned on that radio
hey that's when i realized
it wasn't our song, it was yours
and in conversation baby i was decoration
now i deserve a little bit more than
to talk, walk, think, stop
anytime you want me to
bend all my rules
i used to let you choose
who you wanted me to be
this time i'm flying free
it's my turn to be me
it's my turn to be meon a crowded highway
through a night alone
i was barely breathing
i was crawling home
well, it's quite not london
or the south of france
or an asian island
or a second chance
going back to nashville
thinking 'bout the whole thing
guess you gotta run sometimes
maybe i'm a fast train
blowin' through a valley
watching all my life go by
you're a distant memory
you're an exit sign
i was talking crazy
on the drivers side
and i know i hurt you
but i can't confess
was that blood or a wine stain
on your wedding dress
going back to nashville
thinking 'bout the whole thing
guess you gotta run sometimes
maybe i'm a fast train
blowing through a mountain
watching all my life go by
going back to nashville
laughing at a bad break
what's the use of wondering why?
maybe i'm a storm front
blowing through a valley
tearing up a good july
and its safe and warm
where nothing ever happens
could it be so hard
to realign a star or two
change a southern night for you
going back to nashville
thinking bout the whole thing
guess you gotta run sometimes
maybe i'm a fast train
blowing though a valley
tearing up a good july
i'm going back to nashville
laughing at a bad break
what's the use of wondering why?
maybe i'm a storm front
blowing through the valley
tearing up a good july
going back to nashville
i'm going back to nashville
going back to naaaaahh....
going back to nashville
what's the use of wondering why?i need you now

tomorrow is still an unknown
you think you're all alone in this place
i think you're crazy 'cause i still love you baby
oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new
don't fade away
never fade
hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
somebody blows your candle out
you wore a mask, now that's broken too
everybody else was everything to you
the sun goes down on a good day
tomorrow is still an unknown
you think everybody wants a fight
i think you're crazy 'cause i still love you baby
oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new

i think you fell out of the sky today
i think you know it's true
you've seen the world, now all you see is me
tell me now baby what are you gonna do
oh don't fade away baby
blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
don't count the days as they leave you
count them as you find a day new

look at me
look at who we could be
i wanna know who you are
what you want from the stars
and every time i look at you i can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin and it hits me then
i love you
and every time you look at me i could go crazy but i don't
say it but i won't
'cause i'd rather be alone than lose you
and all i really wanna do is be next to you
but i'm too tired to fight
and i could tell you now
but baby, never mind
all the time
everyday
there's nothing i can do, baby, to make it go away
so look at you
and look at me
and think of who we could be
but every time i look at you i can hardly say a thing
my head starts to spin and it hits me then
i love you
and every time you look at me i could go crazy but i don't
say it but i won't
'cause i'd rather be alone than lose you
and all i really wanna do is be next to you
but i'm too tired to fight
and i could tell you now
but baby, never mind
all i really wanna say is i need you, babe
but how could you understand?
what happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
and i just wish i told you never mind
and i could tell you now, but baby, never mind
yeah, oh yeah
i could tell you now but never mind
yeah, oh yeah yeah
and i could tell you now but never mindit wasn't just like a movie
the rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
i'm driving away and i, i guess you could say
this is the last time i'll drive this way again
when there's nothing to say and i try to grab at the fray
cause i, i still love you but i can't
bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you back but it's coming down to nothing
and all you have is to walk away
from the one thing i thought would never leave me, yeah
the picture frame is empty
it's black and white, you're smiling down at me
i take your photo off the dash
and back to the conversation
i was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
i'm lost in the sound of it
but here in the now comes in
seems like i'm becoming part of your past
bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you back but it's coming down to nothing
and all you have is to walk away
from the one thing i thought would never leave me
and there's so much that i can't touch
you're all i want but it's not enough this time
and i can feel you like your slipping through my hands
and i'm so scared of how this ends
bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side
bye, bye, baby
i want you back but it's coming down to nothing
and all you have is to walk away
from the one thing i thought would never leave me
bye, bye, to everything i thought was on my side

i want you back but it's coming down to nothing
and all you have is to walk away
from the one thing i thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
there was one thing i knew would never leave me
it wasn't just like a movie
the rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skinstanding on the border
looking out into the great unknown
i can feel my heart beating faster as i step out on my own
there's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
i'm heading out tonight, traveling light
i'm gonna start all over again
and buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
see how far i can go
cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know
i will face the world around me
knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go
and i will fall in love again
because i can
gonna climb the mountain
and look the eagle in the eye
i won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high i can fly
how could i have ever believed
that love had to be so blind
when freedom was waiting, down at the station
all i had to do was make up my mind
and buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
see how far i can go
cause i'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
and talk to someone i don't know
i will face the world around me
knowing that i'm strong enough to let you go
and i will fall in love again

and crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt

i remember your little laugh
race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
i love you to the moon and back
i remember your blue eyes looking into mine
like we had our own secret club
i remember you dancing before bed time
then jumping on me, waking me up
i can still feel you hold my hand, little man
and even the moment i knew
you fought it hard like an army guy
remember i leaned in and whispered to you
come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
you were my best four years
i remember the drive home
when the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "why?"
flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
about a beautiful boy who died
and it's about to be halloween
you could be anything you wanted if you were still here
i remember the last day when i kissed your face
and whispered in your ear
come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
you were my best four years
what if i'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
what if i kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through?
what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
you were my best four years
i remember your bare feet down the hallway
i love you to the moon and backi remember tears streaming down your face
when i said, "i'll never let you go"
when all those shadows almost killed your light
i remember you said, "don't leave me here alone"
but all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
just close your eyes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound
don't you dare look out your window darling
everything's on fire
the war outside our door keeps raging on
hold onto this lullaby
even when the music's gone
gone
just close your eyes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound
oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
la la (la la)
la la (la la)
oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
la la (la la)
just close your eyes
you'll be alright
come morning light,
you and i'll be safe and sound...
oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh oh ohlet's watch
the tide chase
the waves
onto the sand
i wonder
if a broken heart
feel the warmth
on my hand
and i wonder
what a piece
of driftwood
has seen all through
his lifetime
let's walk away
the past through
the smokey black nights
i've seen
a million things
spoke a million words
now i only want
to speak to you
waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing
i'd rather do
on the
smokey black nights
still throught
the haze
i can make out
constellations
i'll make one
of you and me
as we sit
in the sand
and i saw
that sunset gleamin
as my eyes went wild
let's walk away
the past through
the smokey black nights
i've played
a thousand songs
sang a thousand words
now i only want
to sing to you
waited on a wire
starin' at the fire
there's nothing
i'd rather do
on the
smokey black nights
i've walked
a thousand miles
smiled
a thousand smiles
now i only smile
when i'm with you
waiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing
i'd rather do
on the
smokey black nights
so walk with me
as the sweet
wind dances
i'll write a song
for you and me
on the
smokey black nightsdays go by, i wonder if you here me
can't you read between the lines?
now i'm standing still, i am disappearing
take this chance, i'll make you mine
don't you wonder why
you change in time
makes you feel so empty inside
but love's got me cornered in the back of the room
i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around
and all i see is someone i don't know
love's got me tangled, tired me too
no sign of a wall, sign of wall,
spinning me around
and baby all i see is you
he tells lies, are you really thinking
that you deserve another try
when you see these eyes
you see another planet
don't ask how, but fate decides
don't you wonder why
you change in time
makes you feel so empty inside
but love's got me cornered in the back of the room
i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around
and all i see is someone i don't know
love's got me tangled, tired me too
no sign of a wall, sign of wall,
spinning me around
and baby all i see is you
spinning and turning
and living and learning
i should be able to handle this
make it or break it
move it or shake it
do it or fake it
girl you've got to make it
but love's got me cornered in the back of the room
i'm spinning around, i'm spinning around
and all i see is someone i don't know
love's got me tangled, tired me too
no sign of a wall, sign of wall,
spinning me around
and baby all i see is you
spinning me around
and baby all i see is you
spinning me around
and all i see is youlet me know, how's it feel
to be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
is it like anywhere you've been?
and everything i do, i do it just for you
so why the hell don't you love me?
why the hell don't you need me like i need you?
are you so far above me?
don't you know that there's nothing i wouldn't do?
but i was just a toy, which you destroyed
stupid boy
i have been looking in, trying to read your mind
give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
and then you walk right by, i'm screaming out inside
why the hell don't you love me?
why the hell don't you need me like i need you?
are you so far above me?
don't you know that there's nothing i wouldn't do?
but i was just a toy, which you destroyed
stupid boy
what happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
you take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
i was gonna be everything you need
'cause you're everything to me
so why the hell don't you love me?
why the hell don't you need me like i need you?
are you so far above me?
don't you know that there's nothing i wouldn't do?
but i was just a toy, which you destroyed
stupid boy
let me know, how's it feel to be under my skintire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
whistle county creek
laying in the green grass, i was watching clouds pass
baby, you were watching me
cold barn struck bed, everything you said
slowly educating me
i never had a lesson so sweet
you can get high on a first kiss
you can get by with sweet tea and god's graces
you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
nothing's shatterproof
you can crash and burn and come back someone new
and that's what i learned from you
autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
just like the two of us
still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
guess i loved you way too much
but i'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
but it's still soft enough to cry
cause i remember those times
i remember.........
you can get high on a first kiss
you can get by with sweet tea and god's graces
you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
nothing's shatterproof
you can crash and burn and come back someone new
and that's what i learned from you
saw you just the other day
all that i could think to say was,
"hey, how have you been?"
you caught me with that old smile
said, "it's really been a while,
and i still think about back when.."
we used to get high on the first kiss
we could get by with sweet tea and jesus
and you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
nothing's shatterproof
you can crash and burn and now i'm someone new
and that's what i learned from you
oh, that's what i learned from you
that's what i learned from you, oh you, oh
that's what i learned from you, oh yeahhit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
you never saw it coming
slipped when you started running
and now you've come undone and i, i, i, i
seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
wish i could make it better
someday you won't remember
this pain you thought would last forever and ever
there you'll stand, ten feet tall
i will say, "i knew it all along."
your eyeswider than distance
this lifesweeter than fiction
just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
all you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
they never saw it coming
you hit the ground running
and now you're onto something, i, i, i say
what a sight, what a sight when the light came on
proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
and in this perfect weather
it's like we don't remember
the rain we thought would last forever and ever
there you'll stand, ten feet tall
i will say, "i knew it all along."
your eyeswider than distance
this lifesweeter than fiction
there you'll stand, next to me
all at once, the rest is history
your eyeswider than distance
this lifesweeter than fiction, fiction
i'll be one of the many saying,
"look at you now, look at you now, now."
i'll be one of the many saying,
"you made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
i'll be one of the many saying,
"look at you now, look at you now, now."
i'll be one of the many saying,
"you made us proud, you made us proud, proud."
and when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
you know that i'll be there time and again
'cause i loved you when, when you
hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
now in this perfect weather
it's like we don't remember
the rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)
there you'll stand, ten feet tall
i will say, "i knew it all along."
your eyeswider than distance
this lifesweeter than fiction
there you'll stand next to me
all at once, the rest is history
your eyeswider than distance
this lifesweeter than fiction, fiction
it's sweeter than fiction
it's sweeter, yeah
it's sweeter than, sweeter
sweeter than fictionit was something like a perfect start to
this love yesterday but now who are you
i thought i knew
your eyes how to know to look right through me
it's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
they weren't true
it's like it wasn't you
could you tell me what did i do
because it can't be we're already through
did you sell me out for a fool
after you held me is that just what you do
what did you need from me

that people change their minds
but that was something i wished you would say
to my face

oh what you get is what you see
baby you hold the key
to the diary of meshould have been different but
it wasn't different, was it
same old story, dear john,
and so long
should have fit like a glove
should have fit like a ring
like a diamond ring
a token of true love
should have all worked out
but it didn't
she should be here now
but she isn't
[chorus:]
there's your trouble,
there's your trouble
you keep seeing double
with the wrong one
you can't see i love you,
you can't see she doesn't
but you just keep holding on
there's your trouble
so now you're thinking 'bout
all you're missing how
deep you're sinking,
round and round and dragging down
why don't you cash in your chips
why don't you call it a loss
not such a big loss,
chalk it up better luck
could have been true love
but it wasn't
it should all add up
but it doesn't
[repeat chorus]
should have all worked out
but it didn't
she should be here now
but she isn't
[repeat chorus]stumble up the porch step
you sat down in the car
only thirteen blocks across this town
to get to where you are
and that dont offer me much time
to make up my mind
so i best be driving slow
on my way to letting go
these headlights they just wanna fade
off into the night
but if theyre half as stubborn as me
theyll just keep on shining bright
i aint ever been one to settle like
the dust does on the dash
since the feeling aint strong
ill just move on
and leave this in my past
once you're gone i know your memory'll
somehow get the best of me
so i question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wondering love how ill act today
until you find somebody new
so ive been holding on
way too long
but not another minute
i'm gonna miss you bad but
cant call it love if you aint in it
red light turns to green
then back to red again
i wish there were some other travelers out here
to slow my travelling
even though the wheel rolled on
inside i still dont know
oh and it troubles me so
once you're gone i know your memory'll
somehow get the best of me
so i question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wondering love how ill feel today
i see you found somebody new
and ive been holding on
way too long
but not another minute
i might miss you bad but
cant call it love if you aint in it
once you're gone i know your memory'll
somehow get the best of me
so i question everything i do
unsure of turning you away
wondering love how ill feel today
i see you found somebody new
so ive been holding on
way too long
but not another minute
i might miss you bad but
cant call it love if you aint in it
your car comes to a rest in the drive
you open up the door and i see you smilewalking downtown shuffling my feet
i try to dream my dreams above the concrete
store windows, traveled for miles
but something i passed really caught my eye
it was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
but i fell in love with this here guitar
nice to meet you, can i teach you
all i know, can you show me what you do
where have you been
what have you seen
who were you before you even knew me
have you been played for endless hours
or were you left in the corner
or were you someone's best friend
this here guitar
it was my baby, anyone could see
i love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
but i can't help wondering why
it came to me and where we'll say goodbye
the cracks down the middle
can't see where they are
since i fell in love with this here guitar
nice to meet you, can i teach you
all i know, can you show me what you do
where have you been
what have you seen
who were you before you even knew me
have you been played for endless hours
or were you left in the corner
or were you someone's best friend
this here guitar
were you a present from a father to a son

i leaned up against your car
and it started rolling down the street
you screamed and ran after it
and tried to open the door
and it ran over your foot
and i was too busy laughing on the ground to see.
it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
when i'm mad at all the lovebirds
'cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'cause that's where you belong
until brad pitt comes along
do you remember the time we watched carrie
and you said it reminded you of me
and i threw the remote at you
and you said "my point exactly"
and later on that night, under the neon city lights,
you paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.
it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
when i'm mad at all the lovebirds
'cause they don't know to play our song
i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'cause that's where you belong
until brad pitt comes along
you call me lucky 'cause i lose everything
but i swear i'd be careful with it
if you gave me a ring
and it would take brad pitt to leave you
it takes five seconds to need you
when i'm mad at all the lovebirds
'cause they don't play our song
i wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'cause that's where you belong

'til brad pitt comes along

i used to be a damsel in distress
you took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale
i wore a dress
you wore a dark grey t-shirt
you told me i was pretty
when i looked like a mess
today was a fairytale
time slows down
whenever you're around
can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale
you've got a smile that takes me to another planet
every move you make everything you say is right
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale
all that i can say
is now it's getting so much clearer
nothing made sense until the time i saw your face
today was a fairytale
time slows down
whenever you're around
yeah yeah
but can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
[instrumental]
time slows down
whenever you're around
i can feel my heart
it's beating in my chest
did you feel it?
i can't put this down
but can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
but can you feel this magic in the air?
it must have been the way you kissed me

oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
today was a fairytaleare you trying to make me fall
'cause with a face like that baby
it won't take too long
keep on melting me with those eyes
and i think in a while i'll be hypnotized
sitting here singing
ooh, ooh, i love you i love you
ooh, ooh, come a little closer
oh, oh, i love you i love you
and i'm down to my last breath
trying to get my heels back under my head
baby somewhere around the time
the moment i saw you
with your hair all sticking up
i was all caught up
'cause baby you were so damn cute
i need you to need me
see the train is coming for me
help me, save me from this crash at last
ooh, ooh, i love you i love you
ooh, ooh, come a little closer
oh, oh, i love you i love you
and i'm down to my last breath
trying to get my heels back under my head
na na na na na na na na na
you seem to be just what i've tried to find
and your name looks so good written next to mine
next to mine
next to mine
ooh, ooh, i love you i love you
ooh, ooh i really really want you
oh, oh i love you i love you
oh, oh..
ooh, ooh, i love you i love you
ooh, ooh, come a little closer
oh, oh, i love you i love you
and i'm down to my last breath
trying to get my heels back under my headi used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemys eyes
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead! long live the king!
one minute i held the keys
next the doors were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells a-ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
once you go there was never
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldnt believe what id become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever wanna be king?
i hear jerusalem bells a-ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i cant explain
i know saint peter wont call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
for some reason i cant explain
i know saint peter wont call my name
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the worldif you had only gotten to me first
if i could write a book on how this hurts
if you could see the way your smile looks to me
if i wasn't scared of the world alone
if i didn't know he loves me so
if i could only find the strength to leave
you'd be with me, so baby
don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait for me
it's so wrong that all i wanna do
is forget it all and just be with you
i have to go 'cause he don't know
but the writing's on the wall
but here we are in so deep
soaking wet
jumping in without no safety net
and i don't know what kinda ropes
would break this kinda fall, so baby
don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go, i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait, wait for me
we can't be together right now
guess there's no use in trying
but if you look at me right now
can you tell that i'm dying
to hold you
but it would be wrong to
so don't you look in my eyes
i might fall in love
with a beautiful boy
i wish that i could touch
you go i hope you think of me
as the stars fall down and the heavens fade
this girl is begging wait for me
don't you look now
don't you look now
i might fall in love
don't you look nowwe used to walk along the street
when the porch lights were shining bright
before i had somewhere to be
back when we had all night
and we were happy
i do recall a good while back
we snuck into the circus
you threw your arms around my neck
back when i deserved it
and we were happy
when it was good baby,
it was good baby
we showed 'um all up
no one could touch the way we
laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm
we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
we used to watch the sun go down
on the boats in the water
that's sorta how i feel right now
and goodbye's so much harder
'cause we were happy
when it was good baby,
it was good baby
we showed 'um all up
no one could touch the way we
laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm
we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
oh, i hate those voices
telling me i'm not in love anymore
but they don't give me choices
and that's what these tears are for
'cause we were happy
we were happy
when it was good baby,
it was good baby
we showed 'um all up
no one could touch the way we
laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm
and you were gonna marry me
when we were happy
yeah, we were were happy
oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
we were happyi got a little thing i call self control
'cause i get a little crazy
when i let too much go
loves a little messy and you are too
right now im scared of both of you
i laugh and i play and i wasnt gonna stray
swore id never let a man in my way
youre the last thing i needed today
and i dont know
where i lost control
and couldnt take it any longer
must have been somewhere between
your smile and the way you say my name
i cant win so i give in
the more i fight it just gets stronger
youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
welcome distraction, welcome distraction
gone and spilled my coffee
tryna get to the phone
'cause it might be you
you just never know
cant talk to my friends
without you coming up
its even kind of cute
the way you cuss
i wrote your name down
a hundred thousand times
'cause it looks so good
right next to mine
youre the last thing i needed tonight
and i dont know
where i lost control
and couldnt take it any longer
must have been somewhere between
your smile and the way you say my name
i cant win so i give in
the more i fight it just gets stronger
youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
welcome distraction
im acting like a girl
with nothing to lose
when did i stop caring
about anything but you
and i dont know
where i lost control
and couldnt take it any longer
must have been somewhere between
your smile and the way you say my name
i cant win so i give in
the more i fight it just gets stronger
youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
welcome distraction, welcome distraction
welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh ohwhat do you say, when you just know

but he's a little bit shy
well here's something you can try

what do you say?
what do you say?
what do you say?
what do you say?she's looking in the mirror
the moment's getting nearer
she thinks about it as she walks her walk
up and down the staircase
make up fresh on her face
she thinks about it as she talks her talk
school dance, first chance
always been a dreamer
there's one guy, she's shy
sees him through the mirror
and everybody looks at her
she thinks about it
blue dress, angel face
looking in the mirror
shoes, purse, hair tied back
and you should see her
she's got her magic
floating through the air
peace, love
one thing leads into another
dream big, aim small
man you gotta love her
she's got her hopes up
got 'em up to there
wondering what to wear
she's standing in her bedroom
he'll be pulling up soon
she thinks about it when she sees headlights
looking out the window
she's got her diary to show
that she's been waiting for this all her life
first date, can't wait
looking in the mirror
heart all wrapped up
wait until he sees her
he's looking right at her
she thinks about it
sixteen blue jeans, abercrombie t-shirt
shoes, purse, hair tied back
and you should see her
she's got her magic
floating through the air
peace, love
one thing leads into another
dream big, aim small
man you gotta love her
she's got her hopes up
got 'em up to there
wondering what to wear
the years went by
the mirror saw her cry
she got up again
she got up again
the wind blew by
the small town lights
she got up again
move out, find out
where the world can take her
bright lights, late nights
living for the greater
move to paris
living on a prayer
peace, love
one thing leads into another
dream big, aim small
man you gotta love her
she's got her hopes up
got 'em up to there
she's got her hopes up
got 'em up to there
wondering what to wear
ohh, oh, oh
wondering what to wearyou walk in here with your guitar man
your shining boots and your full on band
a smile on your face, a knife in your hand
singing songs you've got memorized
with whatever talent money buys
so polished that it slips right through your hands
but don't ruin yourself i ain't your competition
don't flatter yourself that was never my intention
i wanna talk about what you are that i ain't
let's talk about what you do that i can't
let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
let's talk about what you did to get here
let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
let's talk about what you want to be and who i've always been
i walk in here with a beat up case
the same guitar i've always played
and the words i wrote down on a page,
when i was 12 years old a small town raised
you tell the crowd you're paying dues,
i tell them, "this is what i do"
and its what i put my life into,
as i breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
and say life on musical road is rough conditions
but the easy ride was never my ambition
i wanna talk about what you are that i ain't
let's talk about what you do that i can't
let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
let's talk about what you did to get here
let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
let's talk about what you want to be and who i've always been
let's talk about your childhood days
you were the prom queen, i was on this stage
so where's that crown gotten you these days?
when it's me and you and the same damn games
so what have you got that i ain't?
and what can you do that i can't?
let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
let's talk about what you did to get here
let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who i've always beeni can't believe you did it again
walked by and took my heart with you
why did you have to look so good?
don't you know that i'm trying to hate you
trying to have a dream without you in it
but how can i put out this fire
when you're the one who lit it
i can't wait for the day i stop pretending
that i'm really ok when i'm not
i want to know how it feels to be
over you for real
until i do
i'll keep writing songs about you
i've got a stack of papers so high
and it's all about you baby
keep thinking maybe i
can make sense of something crazy
something i can't get out of my head
i write your name i write your name
then i tear it all to shreds
i can't wait for the day i stop pretending
that i'm really ok when i'm not
i want to know how it feels to be
over you for real
until i do
i'll keep writing songs about you
and if you ever change your mind
and want me back again
i hope these songs will remind me
why i shouldn't let you in
i can't wait for the day i stop pretending
that i'm really ok cause i'm not
i want to know how it feels to be
over you for real
until i do
i'll just wait for the day
i stop pretending
that i'm really ok when i'm not
i wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
till i do,
i'll keep writing songs about youi bet you lie awake at night
trying to make up your sweet mind
wondering if you'll ever find
just what you want
a home-town number one
or a california loaded gun
but you know you only get one
or that's what you thought
but here's what you've got
[chorus:]
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer
i could be your little beauty queen
just a little outta reach
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings
if that's what you need
i'd give everything to be your anything
if you want hard to get
if you want...
all you have to do is let me know
if you want a bumpy ride
or someone with a softer side
either one'll be alright
just let me know
cause this is where it goes
[chorus]
it's not like i'm giving up who i am for you
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes in the knees
in the bottom of the top drawer
i could be your little beauty queen
just a little outta reach
or the girl living next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings
if that's what you need
if that's what you need
[chorus]i heard a song tonight on the radio
another girl sings about a boy
just sees his face in every space in every room
and i know that if i turn around you won't be there
if i close my eyes will you be there?
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
coz i'm not scared
of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
i've got a picture of you in my bedroom
and i hope it never falls
and i hope i never lose that feeling
i used to get when you would call
and now i wonder to myself
who were you and where are you?
were you ever here at all?
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
coz i'm not scared
of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
that girl in the song had it so good
i wish i could close my eyes and see you
i wish the sky had your face
and the oceans had your eyes
and the sunset had your lips
and i had you
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake one day
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
coz i'm not scared
of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face
